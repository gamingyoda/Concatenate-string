# Concatenate-string
Concatenate two strings into one string. 

I had an assignment in my programming class to concatenate string types, and I have tried to concatenate them in as many different ways as I could come up with. If you can add more, please feel free to do so.

Sorry for the dirty code, as I am still learning:(
